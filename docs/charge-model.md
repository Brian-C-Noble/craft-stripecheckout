# ChargeModel

Whenever you're dealing with a charge in your template, you're actually working with a ChargeModel object.

## Simple Output

Outputting a ChargeModel object without attaching a property or method will return the charge's formatted amount.

```twig
<h1>{{ charge }}</h1>
```

Would output:

```
5.00 GBP
```

## Properties
